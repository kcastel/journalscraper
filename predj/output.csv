"In communication networks, congestion occurs when a link or node is carrying data beyond its capacity limits and hence its quality of service (QoS) deteriorates. Typical effects of congestion include queuing delay, packet loss (loss of information) or the blocking of new connections. Congestion needs to be controlled to ensure the QoS and also to increase efficiency of the system in order to survive the ever growing competition of service providers in market today. In order to evaluate the QoS it is essential to measure the performance of network in terms of throughput, efficiency, delay, packet dropping probability etc. These parameters are influenced by variations in the network parameters like packet size, packet interval and link capacity. To implement congestion control early detection of packet drop or monitoring link buffer would help avoid congestion. The concentration of this paper is around network parameters, how they affect system performance and how these results can help avoid congestion scenario.","Banshri Raichana, Sangeeeta Kulkarni",Performance measurement of computer networks to improve congestion control,"Home,Vol 1, No 1 (2012),Raichana"
"As network attacks have increased in number and severity over the past few years, intrusion detection system (IDS) is increasingly becoming a critical component to secure the network. Due to large volumes of security audit data as well as complex and dynamic properties of intrusion behaviors, optimizing performance of IDS becomes an important open problem that is receiving more and more attention from the research community. Intrusion poses a serious security risk in a network environment. The ever growing new intrusion types pose a serious problem for their detection. In this paper, a new intrusion detection method based on Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Random Forest with low overhead and high efficiency is presented. System call data and command sequences data are used as information sources to validate the proposed method. The frequencies of individual system calls in a trace and individual commands in a data block are computed and then data column vectors which represent the traces and blocks of the data are formed as data input. PCA is applied to reduce the high dimensional data vectors and distance between a vector and its projection onto the subspace reduced is used for anomaly detection. Experimental results show that the proposed method is promising in terms of detection accuracy, computational expense and implementation for real-time intrusion detection.","Fiona Lowden Lawrence, Sanjay Kumar Sharma, Mahendra Singh Sisodia",Network Intrusion detection by using Feature Reduction Technique,"Home,Vol 1, No 1 (2012),Lawrence"

"Due to the rapid technological progress, the consumption of electric energy increases continuously. But the transmission systems are not extended to the same extent because building  of new lines is difficult for environmental as well as political  reasons. Hence, the systems are driven closer to their limits resulting in congestions and critical situations endangering the system security.Power Flow Control devices such as Flexible  AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) provide the opportunity to inﬂuence power ﬂows and voltages and therefore to enhance system security, e.g. by resolving congestions and improving the voltage proﬁle. Even though the focus lies on Static Var Compensators (SVC), Thyristor-Controlled  Series Compensators (TCSC) and Thyristor-Controlled Phase Shifting Transformers (TCPST), the developed methods can also be applied to any arbitrary controllable devices. In order to beneﬁt from these devices, an appropriate control is necessary. In this thesis, an Optimal  Power Flow problem is formulated and solved to ﬁnd the optimal device settings.","Dr. K.T.

"Intrusion detection is a software application that monitors network and/or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations and produces reports to a Management Station. Security is becoming big issue for all networks. Hackers and intruders have made many successful attempts to bring down high profile company networks and web services. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is an important detection that is used as a countermeasure to preserve data integrity and system availability from attacks. The work is implemented in two phases, in first phase clustering by K-means is done and in next step of classification is done with k-nearest neighbours and decision trees. The objects are clustered or grouped based on the principle of maximizing the intra-class  similarity and minimizing the interclass similarity. This paper proposes an approach which make the clusters of similar attacks and in next step  of classification with K nearest neighbours and Decision trees it detect the attack types. This method is advantageous over single classifier as it detect better class than single classifier system.","Priyanka J.

"This paper focus on an segmentation approach for digital image.  The technique used is to find two main regions ie. The region of interest(foreground) and the background .  the segmentation is the a major problem in computer graphics and computer vision.  There are demands for extracting the region of interest from the image. Therefore it will be more useful to be able to extract the region of interest for further analysis. We have applied PSO  the particle swarm optimization technique, which is an evolutionary computational algorithm. It is a fast and accurate optimization technique applied to the  problem. We have used is Boykov-Kolmogorov max/min cut flow algorithm.  This algorithm is widely used in computer vision and image processing field for its efficiency and speed when dealing with the problem. Graph cut used in this paper  is for segmenting the image. The segmented image is the foreground and the background of the input image.  We have applied our technique for many images, and two of the results are discussed.","Shameem Akthar, Dr. D Rajayalakshmi, Dr. Syed Abdul Sattar",Contour Detection Using PSO and Graph Cut,"Home,Vol 1, No 2 (2012),Akthar"

"Blocking artifact is one of the most annoying artifacts in the image compression coding. In order to improve the quality of the reconstructed image several deblocking algorithms have been proposed. A high-quality modified image deblocking algorithm based on the shape-adaptive DCT (SA-DCT) is shown. The SA-DCT is a low-complexity transform which can be computed on a support of arbitrary shape. This transform has been adopted by the MPEG-4 standard and it is found implemented in modern video hardware. This approach has been used for the deblocking of block-DCT compressed images. In this paper we see modified pointwise SA-DCT method based on adaptive DCT threshold coefficient instead of constant DCT threshold coefficient used by the original pointwise SA-DCT method. Extensive simulation experiments attest the advanced performance of the proposed filtering method. The visual quality of the estimates is high, with sharp detail preservation, clean edges. Blocking artifacts are suppressed while salient image features are preserved.","Chandan Singh D. Rawat, Rohan K.

"Embedded multiprocessor design presents challenges and opportunities that stem from task coarse granularity and the large number of inputs and outputs for each task. We have therefore designed a new architecture called embedded concurrent computing (ECC), which is implement on FPGA chip using VHDL. The performances of a realistic application show scalable speedups comparable to that of the simulation. The design methodology is expected to allow scalable embedded multiprocessors for system expansion. In recent decades, two forces have driven the increase of the processor performance: Advances in very large-scale integration (VLSI) technology and Micro architectural enhancements. Therefore, we aim to design the full architecture of an embedded processor for realistic to perform arithmetic, logical, shifting and branching operations. We will be synthesize and evaluated the embedded system based on Xilinx environment. Processor performance is going to be improving through clock speed increases and the clock speed increases and the exploitation of instruction- level parallelism.

"Watermarking is the technique of adding watermark inside image in such a way that when an unauthorized user tries to use the image with a watermark, he can be caught on the basis of copyrights grounds. Addition of Watermark can be done in visible and invisible manner. Visible watermark places a watermark over an image in such way that it is visible to all the users about the owner of the image and invisible watermarking is done in such a way that watermark content is hidden from the user. This paper presents both invisible and visible watermarking methods applied on digital images for copyright protection and number of attacks that are applied on watermarked images to test the quality of a data. In our purposed scheme we are going to apply DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) to both visible and Invisible Methods. The results are calculated by implemented our purposed scheme with the help of Graphical User Interface in MATLAB 7.6.0. The results are formulated by the calculation of PSNR and BER.","Chirag Sharma, Deepak Prashar",Visible and Invisible Watermarking Methods for Quality loss of data,"Home,Vol 1, No 3 (2012),Sharma"
"Motion estimation is one of the key elements of many video compression schemes. Motion estimation is the process of determining motion vectors that describe the transformation from one image to another; usually from adjacent frames in a video sequence. In this paper we discuss four-step search algorithm, which is a type of block matching algorithm and use for finding motion vector. Four-step search algorithm estimate the amount of motion on a block-by-block basis, i.e. for each block in the current frame, a block from the previous frame is found, that is said to match this block based on a certain criterion. We consider 64* 64 pixel images and find motion vector.

The capacity of the available buffer size in a node is limited. The limited buffer size of each node leads to congestion in the network. In such a case management of buffer in a node plays important role. We propose compression technique that helps to reduce the burden on the buffer and increases the throughput of the network. The proposed compression technique is implemented on hardware and operates real-time to capture data. For the implementation of proposed compression technique we are using a hardware called AVR kit AT mega 32.There are two kits which are act as two nodes in the network. These two nodes are sending data packets in form of bytes to each other. For the data compression we are using Run Length encoding algorithm which show that the proposed technique gives better compression result compared to prior works.,"Ms. Amruta A.

"The area of clone detection has considerably evolved over the last decade, leading to approaches with better results. Since code clones are believed to reduce the maintainability of software, several code clone detection techniques and tools have been proposed. Token-by token matching technique is more expensive than line-by-line matching in terms of computing complexity since a single line is usually composed of several tokens. In this paper token based tools have been evaluated that is, CCfinder and PMD copy/paste detector on the basis of three types of metrics that is, clone set metrics , file metrics , line metrics to investigate the code clones in  source files. The results of the analysis processes show that each tool has its own strengths and weaknesses and no single tool is able to identify all clones within the code.","Rupinder Kaur, Harpreet Kaur, Prabhjot Kaur",EVALUATION OF TOKEN BASED TOOLS ON THE BASIS OF CLONE METRICS,"Home,Vol 1, No 3 (2012),Kaur"

"Radar Cross Section (RCS) depends on the characteristic dimensions of the object compared to the radar wave length. The Radar Cross Section of the target determines the power density returned to the radar for a particular power density incident on the target. The cross section is more dependent on the target shape than its physical size. The radar antenna captures a portion of echo energy incident on it. Radar Cross Section fluctuates as a function of radar aspect angle and frequency.Using the MAT LAB Programming, Prediction of Radar cross section `σ`  for simple shapes of targets like Sphere, Ellipsoid and Circular Flat Plate.

In this project, we have used combined approach of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and discrete wavelets Transform (DWT) for feature extraction and neural network (feed forward back propagation) classifier for classification and recognition purpose. Human mind can easily trace handwritten script so there have we use Artificial intelligence in which we use classifier neural network. The proposed system has been experimented on three handwritten scripts Hindi, English and Urdu. Our database contains 961 handwritten samples, written in three scripts. Every script (Hindi, English and Urdu) contains 320 samples (160 samples are written in small font and another 160 samples are in large font).","Akhilesh Pandey, Sunita Singh, Rajiv Kumar, Amod Tiwari",Handwritten Script recognition using Soft Computing,"Home,Vol 1, No 6 (2012),Pandey"

"A lossless steganography is defined as an original image can be completely recovered from the stego-image after the embedded data has been Extracted. Information hiding is a technique that inserts secret messages into a cover file.  Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity.A lossless or reversible steganography is defined as an original image can be completely recovered from the stego-image after the embedded data has been extracted. This technique has been focused on spatial uncompressed domain recently, and is considered more challenging to carry out in the compressed domain. In this paper, we propose a lossless, compressed domain steganography technique for AMBTC-compressed images based on the interchange of two quantization levels. The location map, which is often used in lossless steganography, is not required in our scheme. Therefore, the hiding capacity is independent of the compressed codes. Moreover, the stego-image preserves the same image quality as the original compressed images. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is not only easy to implement but also provides an efficient mechanism for lossless data embedding","M. PRAMEELAMMA, V. SRIDHAR, G. NAGENDRA, V.

"Automatic multi-stored car parking system is very good substitute for car parking area in the era of miniaturization, where space has become a very big problem. It’s become a very crucial necessity to avoid the wastage of space in modern, big companies and apartments etc. For example, in a space where more than 100 cars need to be parked regularly, it’s a very difficult task to do so. This Automatic Car Parking allows any number of cars can be park according to requirement by enabling the parking of vehicles, floor after floor and thus reducing the space used. This makes the system modern and evens a space-saving one. This idea is developed using AVR ATMEGA 16 Microcontroller based on Zigbee Technology for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). WSN is seen as one of the most promising contemporary technologies for bridging the physical and virtual world thus, enabling them to interact. A WSN is composed of a number of sensor nodes, which are usually deployed in a region to observe particular phenomena in a geospatial domain. Sensor nodes are small stand alone embedded devices that are designed to perform specified simple computation and to send and receive data. They have attached them to a number of sensors, gathering data from the local environment that is being monitored.","Mala Aggarwal, Simmi Aggarwal, R.S.

"The  expectation from the next generation wireless communication networks is  to be able to handle much higher data rates with the higher capacity. A  user, with mobility, will access the network and must be able to use  the system without any difficulty to different networks. The spectra  allocation is expected to be more flexible. MIMO techniques are heavily  exploited and integrated into many wireless standards like  third-generation (3G) and fourth-generation (4G) wireless communication  systems, IEEE 802.11n wireless local area network (WLAN) standard, IEEE  802.20 mobile broadband wireless access system and the 3GPP Long Term  Evolution (LTE) of wideband CDMA (W-CDMA). Multiple-Input  Multiple-Output (MIMO) based Wireless communication systems increased  spectral efficiency for a given total transmit power, increased capacity  by introducing additional spatial channels that are exploited by  space-time coding. In this paper, survey of MIMO system is described and  its concept, factors that can improve the performance of MIMO system.  It includes the channel types, channel coding methods, number of  transmitters and receivers by using space-time-frequency adaptive  processing that can affect the performance of the MIMO.

"A  RFID, GPS & GSM Based Vehicle Tracking and Employee Security System combine the installation of an electronic device in a vehicle, with purpose-designed computer software to enable the company to track the vehicle's location. In vehicle tracking systems we use Global Positioning System (GPS) technology for locating the vehicle. Vehicle information can be viewed on electronic maps via the Internet or specialized software. Due to recently happened mishaps such as burglary, rape cases etc., the employee safety, esp. for the women employees, has become a number one priority for most of the companies. Even though the companies take good precautions to ensure that its employees are safe, there are some serious loop holes in the existing system. Firstly there is no full proof mechanism to track the outsiders to avoid this kind of problem we are going to implement a system that provides more security to the employee. The car Unit is placed inside the car .When the car picks up the employee; he/she needs to swap the RFID card. The micro controller matches the RFID card no. with its database records and sends the employee’s id, cab id & the cab position co-ordinates to the company unit via GSM module. The GSM Modem will receive the message through GSM in the company unit. If employee finds himself/herself in a problem, he/she will press the button. Microcontroller will detect the action & sends a signal to the GSM which will coordinate with to the company unit and police. Microcontroller will also send a signal to the relay which will turn off the car ignition & stop the car. The GSM Modem will receive the message. This message will then be transferred to the computer through the serial port. The employee name, employee id & cab position coordinates (longitude and latitude) get displayed on computer. Once the data is obtained on the computer, it can be used for further analysis. In this way the company unit keeps a track of the vehicle.

In this paper pprivacy attacks to ad hoc routing protocols become an important issue as mobile ad hoc networks enter security critical domains. We modified Rids scheme for node location privacy in ANDOR protocol in mobile adhoc network. RIDS scheme also provide facility for the detection of wormhole attack and node misbehaviors in adhoc network. Different author proposed a different scheme for RIDS for providing security in mobile adhoc network. But all technique suffered common problem that problem is generation of node ID and protection of node ID in location based routing protocol. In this dissertation we modified the RIDS model for node id generation technique for identification of location of secured node. For these process we used cyclic shift technique for node ID generation. Here we discuss RIDS ANDOR and describe our proposed scheme.,"Satish Shrivastava, Nitin Agrawal, Sitendra Tamrakar",Receiver Location Privacy in  MANET By Using cyclic technique for node ID generation,"Home,Vol 1, No 10 (2012),Shrivastava"

"Speaking in terms of authentication and data encryption, the original design of IPv4 totally lacks security mechanisms. The security option in IPv4 header fields only exists as a means of compartmenting the data carried in the datagram. Furthermore, the “security” that it provides is effective only so long as the receivers of IP traffic obey the standard. Applications can provide the means of ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. Part of the problem with depending on applications is that there is no standard, and the methods of securing data vary from application to application. In this paper IPsec architecture is discussed along with the various modes in which it operates for next generation networks.","Savita Shiwani, Prof. G.N.

"Cooperative communication has received tremendous interest for wireless networks. Most existing works on cooperative communications are focused on link-level physical layer issues. Consequently, the impacts of cooperative communications on network-level upper layer issues, such as topology control, routing and network capacity, are largely ignored. In this article, we propose a Capacity-Optimized Cooperative (COCO) topology control scheme to improve the network capacity in MANETs by jointly considering both upper layer network capacity and physical layer cooperative communications. Through simulations, we show that physical layer cooperative communications have significant impacts on the network capacity, and the proposed topology control scheme can substantially improve the network capacity in MANETs with cooperative communications.","AERUPULA UMA, ARUN KUMAR.R, CH.

"Optical filters are a fundamental part of spectrometric measurements of ultraviolet (UV), visible and infrared (IR) radiation. In the present paper, optical filter is considered as a part of an optical system that has the purpose of modifying the intensity, polarization or, in particular, the spectral distribution of light. A beam of light enters through an aperture, is modified, and exits through one or more apertures. For reconfigurable filters a signal is applied to tune the filter’s properties or change between different configurations. Filters of some sort are essential to the operation of most electronic circuits. It is therefore in the interest of anyone involved in electronic circuit design to have the ability to develop filter circuits capable of meeting a given set of specifications. Optical filters are made from glass that absorbs specific wavelengths of the spectrum. They are relatively inexpensive and are very durable under most conditions. Frequency response, signal quality, bit error rates and filter gain in dB are the major interesting parameters for different categories of signal filtering under operation considerations. Capacitance values for filter circuits are estimated based on known corner wavelength for different optical transmission bands.",Ahmed Nabih Zaki Rashed,A new Generation of Optical Filters Performance Response for Different Categories of Signal Filtering,"Home,Vol 2, No 7 (2013),Rashed"

": In the previous paper we have discussed about the water level control in the ‘Three Non- Interacting Tank System’ with help of the Intelligent Fuzzy Controller over the classical method, in which we noticed that the performance of Classical method was very poor, system was slow i.e. response was slow and less accurate than that of Fuzzy Control system[1]. This paper discusses about comparing the performance of Intelligent Fuzzy Control system based on Three, Five and Nine Fuzzy rules. In that either comparing response of a single or interacting tank system with three rule based method, which gives better response, more accuracy than classical method. On the other hand, five rule based method is more complex and more accurate but system becomes slow than three rule based, because as increase in rule base makes system bulky more and more, but accuracy increase. Thus, nine rule based method makes system too bulky due to which system becomes very slow as compared to five and three rule based method but this system is more accurate than others. This paper provides information about complexity of system, performance and accuracy with different rule bases. The system’s overall performance will be optimum but it requires more practice, skill or experience. So, out of Three, Five and Nine rule method, the five rule system shows optimum behaviour.","Ashok Kumar, Rajbir ., Kuldeepak .","Performance Comparison of Level Control with the Three, Five & Nine Fuzzy Rules based method","Home,Vol 2, No 7 (2013),Kumar"
"Recently, researchers have been active in Intelligent Transport System (ITS) development, especially connecting vehicles each other using the Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs).VANETs are distributed, self-organizing communication networks built up by moving vehicles, and are thus characterized by very high mobility and limited degrees of freedom in movement patterns. VANETs are an emerging research area, currently research being focused not only on providing potential applications for such type of networks, but also on providing services for emergency vehicle. We introduce a novel architecture for certain vehicles such as ambulance, fire service vans, police patrols need to be given a high priority in our envisioned network architecture, as their requirements are crucial during emergency situations. The traditional siren, they could use radio communication to warn other vehicles or to preempt traffic lights. We design architecture for an emergency vehicle communication. In VANET, vehicles uses the inter vehicle communication but, also involve roadside infrastructure like traffic lights. In our system other vehicles are warn of an approaching emergency vehicle. They also receive the detail information about the emergency vehicle and other route information. By receiving detail information, timely and correct action taken by the driver is possible, such application saves the valuable time and lives.","Supriya Bhosale, Prof. N. A.

"Wireless sensor networks are rapidly gaining popularity so as to cater to the requirements of different applications. This system unifies various home appliances, smart sensors and energy technologies. The smart energy market requires two types of ZigBee networks for device control and energy management. We use IEEE 802.15.4 and ZigBee to effectively deliver solutions for a energy management and efficiency for home automation. We present the design to evaluate the performance of the home automation users for a network-based smart home energy control. This paper designs smart home energy management descriptions and application environment. Current building control strategies are unable to incorporate occupant level comfort and meet the operation goals. In this, we present a building control strategy that optimizes the tradeoff between meeting user comfort and reduction in operation cost by reducing energy usage. We present an implementation of the proposed approach as an intelligent lighting control strategy that significantly reduces energy cost. Using this we can evaluate the network performance in smart homes.","Ashwini Burkul, Prof. S. S. Wagh, Supriya Bhosale",Smart Energy Management System Using WSN,"Home,Vol 2, No 7 (2013),Burkul"
"In this paper an objective function is formulated to minimize the cost of  reactive power while maintaining the minimum specified voltage security margin along with other constraint. Usually reactive power cost functions are non differentiable. Therefore quadratic opportunity cost function for reactive power has been derived in terms of real power cost parameters and day-ahead data of energy market, and hence the overall objective function is summation of quadratic cost functions of real and reactive power generation. The reactive power output of each generator is divided into three regions and cost of reactive power in each region is defined separately. Therefore optimization problem became highly non-linear and mix-integer in nature. A Sequential quadratic programming algorithm is developed to minimize the cost of reactive power generation along with real power generation to alleviate the bus voltage violations. Reactive power output regions of generators needed integer variable for their selection; therefore, heuristic method (if-then rules) is applied along with Sequential quadratic programming algorithm to alleviate the need of integer variable. The proposed approach is applied on IEEE-14 bus  system.",Anil Gupta,Reactive Power Cost Estimation In Deregulated Electricity Markets,"Home,Vol 2, No 8 (2013),Gupta"

"VANETs are subclass systems of MANETs (Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks) in which there is no access point i.e. each node which are high speed moving vehicles receives and forwards the incoming data in the network. The node Density in VANETs is highly dense and frequently variable whereas sparse in MANETS. It is one of the most emerging fields for researchers & industry community. Importance of VANETs may be seen in the context of safety and comfort applications of vehicles moving on the road. These may include Violation Warning, Back up route information, Electronic Brake warning, Collision warning etc. Mobility of nodes changes the network topology as a result of which several parameters are affected cause in loss of throughput & efficiency of VANETS. Moreover, high Velocity of terminals results in the failure of link on the path between source and destination.

"Voltage stability is  the ability of a power system to maintain acceptable voltages at all nodes in the system under normal condition and when being subjected to disturbances . Voltage instability is becoming a serious problem due to complexity of the network which is becoming more complex due to the increasing demand of power. As power systems become more complex and heavily loaded, along with economical and environmental constraints, Real and Reactive power control/compensation in transmission systems improves the stability of the ac system. It is a very useful part of a power system. It also helps to maintain a substantially flat voltage profile at all levels of power transmission, and it improves performance, increases transmission efficiency, and can avoid voltage collapse. FACTS devices are recognized as a new damping resource for poorly damped, low frequency electromechanical oscillation, which usually takes place in a power system operating with long transmission lines under heavily loaded condition. Nevertheless, the damping effect of FACTS devices is known to be strongly influenced by their location and control system. This paper is motivated to cope with these two challenges. By ways of Modal Analysis, a location index for determining FACTS optimal location is proposed which is suitable and feasible for large- scale power systems. A method for tuning parameters in the FACTS control system with a given configuration is presented simultaneously. We are using STATCOM with Fuzzy logic controller for the same.","Devi singh Meena, Mr. Rohit Gupta",Transmission loadability enhancement by using FACT devices with Fuzzy logic Controller,"Home,Vol 2, No 8 (2013),Meena"

"For high bit rates and long haul optical communication systems using a single-mode fiber, a modulator with low chirp and small size are demanded. An electro-absorption modulator is very attractive because it has some advantages of not only low chirp and small size but also the elimination of polarization control through monolithic integration with a distributed feedback (DFB) laser. The modulation bandwidth of traditional lumped electro-absorption modulators (EAMs) is usually limited by the RC time constant, but the effective resistance R and capacitance C are not easily extracted for advanced device geometries.

This paper presents the comparative performance analysis of controlled interleaved buck converters. The controller implementation requires only a single error amplifier and gives better control performance than controlled conventional dc-dc converter. The control scheme uses voltage feedback with two loops similar to current mode control: one for the slow outer loop and the other for the faster inner PWM control loop. To improve the performance of the converter system a coupled inductor is used. This coupled inductor reduces the magnetic size and also improves the converter’s transient performance without increasing the steady-state current ripple. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated through MATLAB simulations.,"Gaurav Katare, Mrs.Manju Khare",Comparative Performance Analysis of Interleaved Converter controller,"Home,Vol 2, No 10 (2013),Katare"
"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is widely recognized as the key technology for the next generation broadband wireless communication (BWC) systems. Besides high spectral efficiency, reliable performance over fast fading channels is becoming more and more important for OFDM-based BWC systems. The time domain synchronous OFDM (TDS-OFDM) has higher spectral efficiency than the standard cyclic prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM), but suffers from severe performance loss over high speed mobile channels since the required iterative interference cancellation between the training sequence (TS) and the OFDM data block, for the application of compressed sensing (CS) to the estimation of doubly selective channels within pulse-shaping multicarrier systems (which include orthogonal frequency- division multiplexing (OFDM) systems as a special case). By exploiting sparsity in the delay-Doppler domain, CS-based channel estimation allows for an increase in spectral efficiency through a reduction of the number of pilot symbols. In this paper, a fundamentally distinct OFDM-based transmission scheme called compressed sensing -time-frequency training OFDM (CS-TFT-OFDM) is proposed, whereby every CS-TFT-OFDM symbol has training information both in the time and frequency domains and also reduced the number of pilot symbols. Simulation results also demonstrate that CS-TFT-OFDM outperforms TFT-OFDM, CP-OFDM and TDS-OFDM in high speed mobile environments.","Shailu Jain, Dr. Soni Changlani",Compressed Sensing Time-Frequency Training OFDM With High Spectral Efficiency And Improved Performance Of The System,"Home,Vol 2, No 9 (2013),Jain"

Such  issues  include  security,  privacy as well as legal and regulatory risks. We  identify threats and security attributes applicable  in cloud computing. We also select a framework  suitable  for  identifying  information  security  metrics.  Cloud  computing  has  become  an increasingly  popular  means  of  delivering  valuable, IT-enabled business services. Adopting  cloud technology can be an affordable way to get  access  to  a  dynamically  scalable,  virtualized  computing  environment.

"What is image compression? The answer to this question is that Image compression deals with reducing the size of image which can be performed with the help of transformations. Wavelets are used to characterize a complex pattern as a series of simple patterns and coefficients that, when multiplied and summed, reproduce the original pattern .In this paper we have taken the Input image and applied wavelet techniques for image compression and have compared the result with the popular DCT image compression. WT provided better result as far as properties like RMS error, image intensity and execution time is concerned. Now a days wavelet theory based technique has emerged in different signal and image processing application including speech, image processing and computer vision. Wavelets are a class of functions used to localize a given signal in both space and scaling domains. A MinImage was originally created to test one type of wavelet and the additional functionality was added to Image to support other wavelet types, and the EZW coding algorithm was implemented to achieve better compression. Extensive experimentation has been carried out to arrive at the conclusion.","Sitesh Kumar Sinha, Krishna kumar Pandey, Dinesh Moriya",Study of Discrete Cosine Transformation and Wavelet transformation techniques for Image Compression,"Home,Vol 2, No 11 (2013),Sinha"
"In this paper, a new approach to protect the mobile phones from the proximity attacks in the small environment (university campus) is proposed, where the environment is divided into clusters, in each cluster there is one access point; to collect the information from the phones. Moreover, to apply the proposed system each phone in the environment should contain two tables, which are: signature table and blacklist table. The signature table is used to store the signature of the malware, where the blacklist table is used to store the attacker phones ID in the environment. These tables will be updated from the access point after creating a trust between two sides in the same cluster. However, to evaluate and to validate the proposed approach, an evaluation program written in the Microsoft C#.net is used. The evaluation tests show that the proposed approach can stop the attacker from propagating the malware in the mobile phone network and can stop the signature pool problem.","Nadia Al-Rousan, Hazem Al-Najjar",Defending Mobile Phones from Proximity Malware Based on Clustering Approach,"Home,Vol 2, No 11 (2013),Al-Rousan"

"Face recognition can be used in a wide range of applications.  It can be used for security system such as for criminal identification. Yet, face images usually suffer from uneven illumination.  Therefore, face image enhancement is a vital process to improve the quality of face image so that face recognition system can perform effectively. In this research, two new face image enhancement methods have been proposed.  The first method is based on the combination of histogram equalization with gamma intensity correction (CHEGIC).  The second method is a block based contrast enhancement method, taking the idea from homomorphic unsharp masking, partially overlap sub-block histogram equalization (POSHE) and blocking effect reduction filter (BERF).  The performance of these methods are then compared with three conventional contrast enhancement algorithms, namly gamma intensity correction (GIC), histogram equalization (HE), and homomorphic unsharp masking (HUM).

"In image compression, the key challenge is to efficiently represent as well as to encode high-frequency image structural components such as edges, patterns and textures. Therefore it is important to learn image structure and adjust the image representation and prediction scheme in an adaptive manner. To address this issue of lossless image compression, we proposed a scheme to identify image components as structural and nonstructural components based on super-spatial structure prediction. The idea behind the proposed prediction approach is taken from motion prediction in video coding. This super-spatial prediction attempts to find an optimal prediction of structural components within the whole image domain by breaking this neighborhood constraint. In this work, we applied this classification and prediction scheme to lossless image compression and developed lossless image encoder. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that proposed method has competitive compression performance when compared with state-of-the-art image compression methods.","Amruta Shinkar, Dr. S. A.

"Design of fuzzy controller includes mainly selection of rule base, membership functions election and scaling factors. In some applications fixed value of scaling factors generates oscillations in process response. In this paper, an algorithm for tuning of scaling factors of fuzzy PI (proportional-integral) controller based on rule base is proposed. The input scaling factors are tuned by updating factors whose values are obtained using rule base with the error and change in error as inputs. The rules are designed for tuning the scaling factors based on the performance measures such as peak overshoot (OV), Rise time (RT) and Integral of square error (ISE). The performance comparison of conventional FLC with self tuned fuzzy controller has been done in terms of several performance measures such as peak overshoot, settling time, rise time and integral square error (ISE). In addition to the responses due to step set-point change, a disturbance is also added in some systems. Simulation results show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed self tuning mechanism. A simulation analysis of a wide range of processes with and without delay time is carried out and comparison of results shows improvement due to self tuning of fuzzy controller.","Neha K.

"Images are very important part of today’s life. It also plays key role in all real world problems such as road or railway track images are used for traffic analysis.  But images captured in outdoor suffer from low contrast. When weather conditions are not good and clear, the light capture by the lens is spread by the atmosphere. Therefore conventional techniques for image enhancement   are not enough to remove weather effects from captured images. The cloudy, foggy, or hazy weather conditions result as image color alteration and shrink the resolution and the contrast of the captured object in open-air.  In this work, we analyzed existing techniques used in image processing to remove bad weather effect. On the basis of this analysis this work proposes an efficient technique for more visibility from a grayscale and color images. This paper proposes an efficient and fast fog removal technique with quality enhancement. This method involves two phases. The first phase is used to remove fog from an image for which we are using a Fog removal technique based on prior knowledge. Second  phase enhance quality of image for improved visibility and noise reduction using FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation). This method is efficient under a broad range of weather conditions including cloud, smog, fog etc. This method can be applied to any type of images like RGB Color, gray scale.","Ashish Saxena, Rajeev Saxena, Yogadhar Pandey",An Exhaustive Analysis On Various Foggy Image Enhancement Techniques,"Home,Vol 3, No 1 (2014),Saxena"

"The mutual coupling between two wire scatterers having exact current distribution that is in fact closer to cosinusoidal distribution is not available in the literature. In order to derive closed form expressions, the current is often crudely approximated using a piecewise sinusoidal distribution leading to inaccurate results. In this paper, the exact distribution on wire scatterers is approximated using a more accurate two term approximation. It has been shown that the results obtained using two term approximation are very close to the cosinusoidal distribution and  much better than the widely used piecewise sinusoidal  approximation (PWS). It has been shown that the error in  mutual coupling evaluated  using two term approximation is less than 1%  for scatterer lengths up to 0.75λ as compared to an error of more than 4% for piecewise sinusoidal approximation.

"The design of a UWB system optimized for very high bit-rate, low-cost, and low-power wireless networks for personal computing (PC), consumer electronics (CE), and mobile applications. The system combines OFDM modulation technique with a multibanding approach, which divides the spectrum into several sub-bands, whose bandwidth is approximately 500 MHz. In order to attain >500Mbps for short range communication, two classical solutions are feasible: either use very short spreading sequences or very large bandwidth. These classical strategies increase intersymbol interference. In contrast, our approach consists in allocating multiple long codes to each user. Long codes allow coping with channel impairments while the use of multiple codes maintains very high bit rates. With such high data rates the receiver obviously has to be simple by requiring a low complexity digital processing. This paper shows that the proposed strategy is compatible with simple receivers. In fact, even if the amount of interference increases, joint usage of very long codes and simple linear receiver can result in high data rate, high performance UWB system.","Mr.Bipeen B.

"Reversible data hiding with image encryption is a technique, in which a secret data is embedded inside a confidential image in such a way that, at the receiver side, both the image and the data can be extracted without any loss. Existing data hiding methods embed data by vacating room after image encryption. This may lead to error during the data extraction and the image recovery. However secure reversible data hiding embed the data before image encryption with a RDH technique, such that the data hider can reversibly embed the data in an easy manner. The proposed method can achieve real reversibility, means that, data extraction and image recovery are free of any error. It can be used in situations where both image and data have equal importance. Moreover before encrypting the image, it is split into shares to enhance security of image while transmitting through the network.

"This study of collective behavior is to understand how individuals behave in a social networking environment. Oceans of data generated by social media like Face book, Twitter, Flicker, and YouTube present opportunities and challenges to study collective behavior on a large scale. In this work, we aim to learn to predict collective behavior in social media. In particular, given information about some individuals, how can we infer the behavior of unobserved individuals in the same network? A social-dimension-based approach has been shown effective in addressing the heterogeneity of connections presented in social media. However, the networks in social media are normally of colossal size, involving hundreds of thousands of actors. The scale of these networks entails scalable learning of models for collective behavior prediction. To address the scalability issue, we propose an edge-centric clustering scheme to extract sparse social dimensions.

"Cybercrime is one of the leading threats to company confidential data and resources. Now a days the criminal activities through the Internet (like stock crime, sniffing, bank fraud) and through the network are on large scale. If a person or entity is attempting to commit fraud or participate in some sort of illegal activity, they will attempt to convey their actions as close to legitimate actions as possible. Here in this paper we are providing the information that a person who is in initial stage of the cybercrime, what co related crimes or illegal activities he can do in future. The future activities that can be performed by the person can be stopped by showing the relationships with the entries stored in the database. Previously existing graph mining algorithm typically assumes that database is relatively static. Here we investigate new approaches for frequent graph based pattern mining in graph databases and proposed a new algorithm that deals with large database which captures the properties of graph in few parameters and check the relationship among them in both left as well as right direction. To overcome that we proposed a new algorithm, thus adopting DFS as well as BFS approach. It further finds the sub graph by traversing the graph and extracting the desired pattern. The proposed algorithm is used for detection of cybercrime capturing the properties  and identifying  the relationship & associations that may exist between the person involved in that crime which prevent several crimes that might occur in future.

"A WSN can be defined as a network of devices, denoted as nodes, which can sense the environment and communicate the information gathered from the monitored field (e.g., an area or volume) through wireless links. The data is forwarded, possibly via multiple hops, to a sink that can use it locally or is connected to other networks (e.g., the Internet) through the gateway. The existing concept uses a link-aware clustering mechanism, called LCM, to determine an energy-efficient and reliable routing path from source node to sink. The LCM primarily considers node status and link condition, to evaluate the qualification of the nodes for clusterheads and gateways to construct clusters. Even though this system is energy efficient, the more number of cluster formation, which is not necessarily needed for establishing a reliable routing path, can decrease the network lifetime. This paper proposes Greedy hop Link-Aware Clustering Mechanism for efficient data gathering by reducing the number of hops it takes while cluster formation and it establishes a more stable link between source and destination. The selection of forwarding candidates is based on priority and the priority of candidate is calculated using node status, residual energy, link condition and the distance to the destination. Thus by implementing Greedy hop method, the overhead of cluster formation can be reduced, thus making the performance of the protocol more efficient for data gathering compared to the existing clustering technique.","Jinju Annie George, Shyjith M.B M.B",Reliable and Efficient Data Transfer with Minimum Drop and Recovery Mechanism Using LCM in Wireless Sensor Network,"Home,Vol 3, No 3 (2014),George"
"Cognitive Radio Networks (CRN) provides a promising solution to solve the scarcity of radio spectrum by the investigation of Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols. MAC protocols are used to sense the channels for data transmission and are considered for the secondary users to efficiently utilize and share the spectrum licensed by the primary user. One important issue associated with MAC protocol design is how the secondary users determine when and which channel they should sense and access without causing harmful interference to the primary user. Normal Spectrum Sensing (NSS) is used at the beginning of each frame to determine whether the channel is idle. Then the secondary users employ CSMA for channel contention on detecting the available transmission opportunity. Fast Spectrum Sensing (FSS) is inserted after channel contention to promptly detect the return of the primary users. So the primary users can benefit from more protection by using FSS. In addition, this work investigates how the performance of the proposed protocol will be if there are different Selfish Attacks and Detection in Cognitive Radio Networks. CRN have several intrinsic security threats due to the opportunistic exploitation of the bandwidth in cognitive radio network. In particular, jamming is one of the most challenging security threats for Cognitive Radio Networks.

"Formal Methods are necessary for the specification, development and verification of safety critical systems. Formal Languages help us to identify errors at an early stage in the development process and can aid in reducing overall system development costs. Despite their benefits, formal methods are not widely accepted in the industry due to the need for high abstraction and a mathematical labor pool. The SOFL (Structured Object-Oriented Formal Language) methodology can be effective and efficient for safety critical systems. Some major issues with formal languages like higher abstraction levels, the need of mathematical skills, developer maturity and high costs can be overcome by using SOFL. SOFL specifically encapsulates three major layers: 1) structured methodology in the early stage of development, 2) object oriented methodology at the detailed level and 3) incorporation of formal methods. In this paper, we have tested the SOFL 3-step approach for the formal specification of a Railway Signaling System ,already implemented by using Zed.

"Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have lot of interest in research due to their wide range of typical application areas such as environmental, military and commercial enterprises. Sensor network possesses unique challenges to protocol builders, because these tiny wireless devices are often deployed in unattended environment with limited capabilities. Hence these networks are vulnerable to different types of malicious attacks. This paper focused on secured communication in wireless sensor network.   Security is a common concern for any network system, but security in WSN is of great importance to ensure its application success. The data is protected against unauthorized modification, deletion, creation, and replication and provides an indication of these unauthorized. When setting up a sensor network, one of the first security requirements is to establish cryptographic keys for later secure communication. The established keys should be resilient to attacks and flexible to dynamic update. In this proposed paper we use Waspmote is a sensor device and meshlium is a gateway. The new Encryption Libraries are designed to add to the Waspmote sensor platform the capabilities necessary to protect the information gathered by the sensors. In this proposed system we use three security techniques to product our data and key from unauthorized user. There are AES 128, RSA 1024, and SHA. For information and packet encryption AES128 is used and MD5 & SHA are used to check the final information received correspond with the orginal sent and RSA1024 is used for key encryption.

"Due to the rapid increase in the use of Instant Messaging (IM) among people, there exists a severe threat from attackers, who can sniff the data and also implant worms since the communication between two users of many IM systems are not secure. This increases the need for a secure, lightweight cryptographic system to enhance the security of the existing IM system. In this paper we are using a new algorithm based on Identity Based Cryptosystems (IBC) which is an emerging concept in Cryptography and an extension to public key cryptosystems. In IBC, we can use any public information such as the e-mail address, name, phone numbers, etc., as a public key which resolves the problem of getting the public key of a user and checking the validity of certificate and helps to avoid the trust problems encountered in traditional certificate based PKI. IBC can provide strong authentication, confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation among users of Instant Messengers and thus enhances the security of existing IMs.","A.RamaKrishna Reddy, M.

"Due to the rapid growth of portable electronic component, the low power arithmetic circuits have become very important in VLSI industry. Multiplier-Accumulator (MAC) unit is the main building block in DSP processor. Full Adder is a part of the MAC unit can significantly affect the efficiency of whole system. Hence the reduction of power consumption of Full Adder circuit is necessary for low power application. Design of area and power-efficient high-speed data path logic systems are one of the most substantial areas of research in VLSI system design. In digital adders, the speed of addition is limited by the time required to propagate a carry through the adder. Carry Select Adder (CSLA) is one of the fastest adders used in many data-processing processors to perform fast arithmetic functions. From the structure of the CSLA, it is clear that there is scope for reducing the area and power consumption in the CSLA. This paper uses a simple and efficient gate-level modification to significantly reduce the area and power of the CSLA. The CSLA is used in many computational systems to alleviate the problem of carry propagation delay by independently generating multiple carries and then select a carry to generate the sum. However, the CSLA is not  area efficient  because  it uses  multiple  pairs  of Ripple  Carry Adders  (RCA)  to generate  partial  sum and carry by considering carry input  Cin = 0 and Cin =1,  then  the  final  sum  and  carry  are  selected  by  the Multiplexers (mux). This is modified by replacing the RCA with Cin=1 with BEC in the regular CSLA to achieve low area and power consumption. But there is a slight increase in the delay. The Power can be drastically reduced by replacing a D-Latch in place of RCA with Cin = 1thereby achieving lower area and low power consumption.","Vidhya. M, Muthammal.

"Image processing is important on various fields to achieve various functions. In this paper two classes of regularization strategies to achieve image recovery and reduce noise suppression from Original image in projection-based image deblurring. Landweber iteration leads to a fixed level of regularization, which allows us to achieve fine-granularity control of projection-based iterative deblurring by varying the value. Regularization filters can be gained by probing into their asymptotic behavior—the fixed point of nonexpansive mappings.   Different image structures (smooth regions, regular edges and textures) are observed correspond to different fixed points of nonexpansive mappings when the temperature (regularization) parameter varies. Such an analogy motivates us to propose a deterministic annealing based approach toward spatial adaptation in projection-based image deblurring.","Mr. M. Yasin, Mr. AR.

"This paper highlight needs to solve security problem in our network society. As the important implementation of biometric technology; palmprint verification is one of the most reliable personal identification method which is most useful technique in forensic science. Palm print are potentially a good choice for biometric application because they are invariant with a person, easy to capture and difficult to duplicate. They have greater security than fingerprint because palm veins are more complex than finger veins. This paper introduces hiding technique to address the vulnerabilities of a palmprint recognition system against attacks. To achieve this, palmprint image is embedded in to host image. The origin of the palmprint images is proven by checking matching percentages of encoded and decoded image. The results obtained have shown that using this concept can efficiently protect a palmprint recognition system against replay attacks.

"In the today’s high scale communication of data there is a pressing need is generated for protection of the data information from many of the illegal duplication and modifications. For this purpose image watermarking is getting a very growing focus for a solution to the theft and tampering by involving the applications of advanced digital image  processing operations to watermark copyright and authentication information inside the image content.  Image watermarking is a signal that is embedded in a image data permanently such that it can be extracted by dewatermarking using some operations for checking the authenticity of data or user. The watermark is inseparable from the host image and it should be robust enough to resist any modifications along with preserving the image quality. In this way the watermarking helps in keeping intellectual properties accessible while being permanently water marked. We have considered  four pairs of different images and applied SVD-DCT_DWT, SVD-DWT  , SVD-DCT watermarking algorithms  and after watermarking we have investigated the peak signal to noise ratio(PSNR) in between our host  image and watermarked image.After watermarking  we have added different image attacks like Gaussian noise,salt and pepper noise,motion blur and Gaussian blur on the watermarked images.After  processing images to the attacks we applied dewatermarking algorithm to extract our watermark image from the watermarked image . We have check the performance of our algorithm  by calculating PSNR in between watermark  and extracted watermark image along with the evalution of normalized correlation (NC).","Pranjali shastri, Vijay kumar singh",Design and Comparative analysis using SVD-DCT-DWT Composite Watermarking Scheme having Robustness to noise and blurring effect,"Home,Vol 3, No 4 (2014),shastri"
"In this paper, we propose a novel approach for performing high quality edge-preserving image filtering called LLSURE filter. Derived from a local linear model and using the principle of stein’s unbiased risk estimate as an estimator for the mean squared error from the noisy image only, we derive a simple explicit image filter which can filter out noise while preserving edges and fine scale details. Moreover, the LLSURE filter naturally has a fast and exact linear time algorithm, regardless of the kernel size and the intensity range; thus, it can be applied to real time image processing tasks. The Experiments show that the LLSURE filter is both effective and efficient in a great variety of computer vision application, including noise reduction, detail enhancement and smoothing, flash/no-flash denoising, image matting/featuring, dehazing.","R.

"Classification is a crucial subject in data mining and machine learning, that's been studied extensively and has a wide range of applications. Classification based on association rules, otherwise known as associative classification, is usually a technique that uses association rules to create classifier. CMAR employs a novel data structure, association rule, to compactly store and efficiently retrieve many rules for classification. Association rule is really a prefix rule structure to research the sharing among  rules, which achieves substantial compactness. To speed in the mining of complete pair of rules, CMAR adopts a variant of recently developed FP growth method. FP-growth is quite a bit faster than Apriori-like methods utilized in previous association-based classification, for example particularly there exist a huge number of rules, large training data sets, and long pattern rules. We use classification using association rules not just to solve classification problems, but that compares the standard of different association rule mining approaches. Therein context we show which the quality of rule sets in the standard algorithm for association rule mining might be improved using a different association rule mining strategy Above classification minute rates are 80%( MAX) hence the 20% data are unclassified. This is the challenge in the field of data classification.

"In the present paper, the performance of the submarine optical communication systems for under( guided cable) and on the surface (unguided cable) of the seawater is investigated, taking into account both the pressure, the temperature and salinity effects. Both the pressure and the temperature are depth-dependent variables, while both the spectral losses and the dispersion effects are temperature as well as wavelength dependent variables. Two important cases with real fibers are processed; a case with dispersion cancellation and a case without dispersion cancellation. It is found that the ocean pressure (due to the depth) shifts the dispersion-free wavelength towards the third communication window. The depth increases the maximum transmitted bit rate increases in the range of interest.

"In the ad hoc network the nodes are not in a stable state. They are in moving state. So,  whenever the node moves from one partition to another partition the node needs a new address to communicate with in this partition which will be unique and not colloid with the address of the nodes in that partition. In the ad hoc networks, the collision free address assignment is a major problem. So, the IP address assignment for ad hoc nodes requires a distributed procedure to resolves all the address collisions in a dynamic network with channel weakening, recurrent partition, and joining or leaving nodes. The mobility of the nodes in ad hoc network makes frequent network partitions. The node in the ad hoc network needs unique network address to enable routing in multi-hop networks. The joining and leaving node is difficult to make the address assignment. A filter-based addressing protocol is light weight and robust to packet losses for address auto-configuration. We use light weight protocol to address the issues and use robust addressing scheme to shares all nodes in allocated list. The protocol controls a distributed database on filter to reduce the overhead and allow an accurate detection of partition merging. To overcome this problem, we propose a collision free address assignment to resolves all the address collisions and reduce traffic when compared to the other addressing protocols.","D. Suganthi, S.

"Identifying user information needs is always one of the most challenging issues in the development of web search engines. The feedback terms imply the actual need of the user. Different users may have different search goals when they submit it to a search engine. The inference and analysis of user search goals can be very useful in improving search engine relevance and user experience. The goal of the proposal is to infer user search goals by analyzing search engine query logs. The feedback terms are clustered to infer the different user search goals for a query. Clustering feedback terms is more efficient than clustering search results or clicked URLs directly. Feedback terms are constructed from user click-through logs and can efficiently reflect the information needs of users. The distributions of different user search goals can be obtained conveniently after feedback sessions are clustered. A pseudo-document which can effectively reflect the information need of a user is formed by combining the enriched URLs in a feedback terms.

"Cloud computing has been around for some years as a new programming model that enables commodity computing. Without capital investment people and organizations can access huge amount of computing resources in pay per use fashion. Cloud provides various services including storage. While cloud users are being served, the resources of cloud are utilized as per the requirements. However, the resource utilization may experience skewness which needs to be avoided. Many algorithms came into existence in order to overcome this problem. In this paper a new algorithm is proposed for optimal resource allocation in cloud computing for high utilization of resources. Our algorithm considers two cases to act up on. In the first case when VM has scarcity of resources, its capacity gets increased by assigning idle resources to VM or assigning free memory of physical machine. The second case makes use of a technique in which a VM is migrated from one physical machine to another physical machine where abundant resources are available. We built a prototype web application that demonstrates the proof of concept. The application simulates the two cases proposed in the algorithm with visual clues. The empirical results reveal that the proposed algorithm is useful and can be used in real cloud computing applications.","J. Rajani, C.Vasu Murthy, S.G.

"In Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) every node is mobile and autonomous. Since there is no infrastructure in such a network, a highly adaptive routing scheme to deal with the frequent topology changes is required. Include large numbers of nodes by that routing packets required a large percentage of the limited wireless bandwidth and this is overstated and exacerbate by the mobility feature often resulting in a lot of data failure regarding wireless links. Due to the limited bandwidth, congestion is the major problem in MANET. The AOMDV maintains the alternate routings possibilities so that these paths can be utilize when the primary path fails. AOMDV protocol can decrease the overall performance when the predefined alternative path no longer satisfies the routing requirement due to the frequent topology changing. In this paper we propose a congestion control load balancing scheme with multipath AOMDV protocol to reduce the problem of congestion.  In this scheme the rate of sender is controlled through Acknowledgement (ACK) scheme but some time the sender is taken to control  then in that case the packets are stored in the memory(queue) of nodes and also that memory management scheme is assigned. This scheme is used to handle the packets beyond the capacity, so that the packet dropping is minimized. The original AOMDV is not capable only to balance the load in network efficiently. The simulation results of proposed scheme significantly increase the packet delivery ratio and decrease the average delay, the performance is better than other protocols.","Geetika Maheshwari, Mahesh Gour, Dr. Sadhna K.

"A battery operated, energy- and cost-effective power ultrasound unit is developed. It is used for purification of contaminated water in combination with an UVC-LED based disinfection system by utilizing acoustic cavitation. Thus biofilm formation is prevented and synergistic effects with UVC-rays enhance disinfection efficiency [1]. The ultrasound unit consists of a Langevin type ultrasonic transducer driven by a specific ultrasound generator optimizing power consumption. It delivers up to 3 watts acoustical output using an excitation voltage amplitude of 100 Vpp. Furthermore the generator is capable of producing a maximum electrical power output of about 23 watts. Drifts of the transducer’s resonance frequency would decrease the  power efficiency of the system [2]. In order to reduce this effect an algorithm was implemented for adjusting the optimum driving frequency of the transducer after well- defined time intervals.

"Data clustering means partitioning the samples in similar clusters, in a way that samples in each cluster have the maximum similarity to each other and have the maximum difference with those in other clusters. Due to unsupervised nature of clustering problems, choosing a specific algorithm for clustering an unknown dataset is risky and usually fails its objectives. Because of the complexity of this problem and poor performance of basic clustering methods, today the majority of studies in this field are focused on ensemble clustering methods. Diversity and quality of initial results are two of the most important factors that can affect the quality of final results obtained from ensemble clustering, and both factors have been significantly assessed in the recent studies regarding this field. In this paper, a new framework is proposed to improve the efficiency of ensemble clustering. This framework is based on using a subset of initial clusters and selection of this subset plays a crucial role in the performance of the ensemble, so the process of selection is carried out with the help of two intelligent methods. The main idea of the proposed method for the selection of a subset of clusters is to use the stable clusters with the help of intelligent search algorithms.  The stability criterion based on mutual information is used to evaluate the clusters. In the end, the selected clusters are aggregated with the help of multiple final clustering techniques.

"Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a 4G communication standard in mobile communication developed by 3GPP. LTE assure reliability, broad coverage, low latency and faster speed as compared to 3G. Seamless handover is the key for the mobile users. LTE provides good handoff solutions to assure the get connected status to the user. The fundamental LTE model has not enriched with security measures during handoff. Various researchers have proposed a numerous solution related to authentication in LTE handover. Most of them have used the concept of the PKI cryptography to achieve the same. In this paper, we have proposed a Light-Weight Authentication (LWA) system for LTE during handoff. The idea behind the proposed approach is to Authentication Digest (AD) with Hash function which has been exchange between UE’s to eNB (Home AP) and same AD has been exchanged between eNB to eNB (Visitor AP). Proposed system has generated a hash random number called AD which has been further used to authenticate the UE’s onto the eNB. Hence LWA has eliminated the need of PKI such RSA (Key generation and Validation) and save the costs. Obtained results shows that proposed LWA outperform than existing methods.","Moazzam Khan, Shubha dubey",Light-Weight Authentication Scheme for Handoff in Long Term Evolution (LTE),"Home,Vol 4, No 9 (2015),Khan"

The main objective is to damp the power system oscillations and to enhance the system dynamic performance under severe disturbances. However, the PSS does not guarantee the system stability when the system conditions vary abruptly whereas SVM does. Particularly, for the transmission lines loaded over a very long distance in a multi-machine system it is unable to damp the interbred oscillations under severe disturbance. FACTS technology provides extensibility on AC transmission system over very long distances by controlling the active and reactive power flows.

"A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a temporary network set up by wireless mobile computers (or nodes) moving arbitrary in the places that have no network infrastructure. Since the nodes communicate with each other, they cooperate by forwarding data packets to other nodes in the network. Therefore the nodes ﬁnd a path to the destination node using routing protocols. However, due to security vulnerabilities of the routing protocols, wireless Sensor Networks are unprotected to attacks of the malicious nodes. One of the most malicious threats to WSN is in the form of black hole attack that target the routing protocols. Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) Routing Protocol is used for ﬁnding a path to the destination in an ad-hoc network. To ﬁnd the path to the destination all nodes work in cooperation using the routing control messages. AODV Routing Protocol oﬀers quick adaptation to dynamic network conditions, low processing and memory overhead, low network bandwidth utilization with small size control messages. A wireless sensor network consists of a large number of small sensors with limited energy. Clustering the sensor nodes is an eﬀective technique to achieve these goals. Network is divided into number of clusters. Nodes are assigned to the cluster having minimum distance to the cluster head having maximum energy. The distance is calculated using Euclidean Distance Formula.

Clustering is one of the important approaches of data mining that can be used for data analysis and is applicable in different fields. Clustering divides those groupings which are more similar in the case of interest parameters. Bee colony algorithm is one of the existing algorithms for clustering. The bee colony algorithm is one of the new stochastic optimization that is inspired by the collective behavior of bees. One problem with this algorithm is late converging and trapping in local optimum. This article compares the bee colony algorithms which are proposed to solve the problem of clustering.

"This paper proposes a technique for increasing the accuracy of lymphoblastic cancer/cell detection in blood samples. The proposed technique utilizes the microscopic images of blood samples to visualise and identify the lymphoblastic cancer cells. These microscopic images are first enhanced using several image processing steps and subsequently, several features are extracted by examining the changes in texture, shape, color, and statistical behaviour of these enhanced images; thereafter, the artificial neural network is trained based on these extracted features in order to detect these cancer cells with high accuracy. Accordingly, the trained artificial neural network classifier categories the image into two classes, namely; normal and abnormal White Blood Cells by using an appropriate set of features and hence, detecting the lymphoblastic cancer/cells. For proof of concept, 36 microscopic images of blood samples are tested using the proposed technique and an overall accuracy of 97.8% is achieved.","Savita Dumyan, Ankush Gupta",An Enhanced Technique for Lymphoblastic Cancer Detection Using Artificial Neural Network,"Home,Vol 6, No 4 (2017),Dumyan"
"Copy–move image tampering is one of the most frequently tampering types that contaminate images authenticity due to its ease. Tampering detection becomes more difficult when the tampered parts are subjected to post operations like scaling, rotation, compression or noise. In this paper, a blind copy-move tampering detection and localization method is proposed. Its novelty lies in the combination of SIFT, PCA and DBSCAN techniques. The proposed method shows its potential to disclose and localize tampered regions of different sizes and shapes. Furthermore, our method requires no prior information about the image or the manipulation operations carried on it.  A comparative analysis between the proposed method and other tampering detection methods is evaluated based on various performance measures. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the previous reported techniques and is quite reliable in copy-move tampering detection and localization.","Mona F.

"Facial landmark localization is one of the basic approaches to identify face alignments, achieve facial expression recognition and perform the same, even in the presence of occlusions. The acquisition conditions such as background complexity, degree of occlusion, illumination variations and expressions on the face affect landmark localization performance. Use of Eigen faces for shape modeling degrades the performance of the system as Eigen faces are not robust to variations in shape, pose and expression. In the proposed work, Landmark detection and localization is carried out using Point Distribution Model (PDM). The proposed method is implemented on MATLAB 2015a using existing standard datasets and very own dataset. Results obtained from the experiment indicate that proposed work detects and localizes facial landmarks more effectively when encountered with images exhibiting different degree of occlusions, expressions and pose variations. This, in turn makes the system more robust.","Jayashree S Katagihalli, SriKrishna Shastri C, Naveen S Pagad",Facial Landmark Detection and Localization Using Point Distribution Model,"Home,Vol 6, No 4 (2017),Katagihalli"

Images need to be retargeted to different sizes and shapes including nonrectangular shapes.  This paper proposes a retargeting algorithm that retargets images to a large family of nonrectangular shapes specified by the application. The main objective of this algorithm is preservation of the image content during transformation. This algorithm is based on removing segments of seams based on a cost function. This cost function is calculated by using the image and the target shapes as inputs. This removal reshapes the boundary of the image into nonrectangular shapes. This algorithm can retarget effectively to a large family of nonrectangular shapes known as bhv-convex shapes.

"Spatial Database more the uncommon word more is it associated to the life of every individual in several different ways. These spatial databases have objects that have certain keywords associated to represent their businesses, services provided or any specific features. Closest Keywords Search an associated problem is to process objects known as keyword cover, that together surrounds a set of query keywords that have a minimum inter – object distance and also are closer to the search location. Keyword Rating can affect various decision making situations that evaluate objects. Best Keyword Cover the most common version of Closest Keywords Search takes into consideration the minimum inter – object distance and the respective keyword ratings. The Baseline Algorithm tends to combine objects from different query keywords to exhibit candidate keyword cover. But the baseline algorithm fails to exhibit its performance level when query keywords increase in number. To overcome this drawback we use more scalable algorithm called keyword nearest neighbour expansion (keyword-NNE) that comparatively is more superior and shows a significant decrease in the number of candidate covers generated. To optimize the solution even more we use the distance of the query objects from the current location.

The master slave configuration is an efficient method to build a model which consists of numerous commands as this enables segregation of one task from the rest. This configuration allows all the slaves to re-energize as the slaves are programmed to accept only certain commands while rejecting the rest. The rejected commands from one slave are accepted by the next slave thus making sure that all the commands are attended and non of the slaves are drained and have sufficient time to recharge.

This paper will perform experiments on radio propagation models, ray tracing models and perform its simulations in Matlab, as well as provide a review of the various path loss models. The simulation results obtained indicated that when the receiver far away from the transmitter, the signal begins to be weaker and weaker until it is lost.

"The massive growing demands for radio wireless communications have resulted in a spectrum scarcity problem. Cognitive radios utilize a dynamic spectrum access to share the spectrum with licensed frequency bands in an opportunistic manner. The integration of cognitive radio with wireless sensor nodes can improve spectrum utilization and increase communication quality. Currently, clustering protocols have been developed to minimize energy consumption and to prolong network’s lifetime. However, spectrum awareness in not considered. Thus, clustering protocols need to adapt to the changes in the surrounding environment and to optimally consider both energy efficiency and spectrum awareness. Therefore, this paper develops a fuzzy based energy efficient and spectrum aware clustering protocol (FEESA) to optimally elect cluster heads based on four conflicting parameters: residual energy, distance to base station, node degree, and channel availability. The performance of the proposed protocol is simulated using MATLAB and Mamdani fussy inference system.  Two simulation scenarios and three performance metrics were used. The proposed fussy clustering protocol is compared with three different protocols: a basic energy efficient protocol, a spectrum aware protocol, and an energy efficient spectrum aware protocol which uses a weighting function.

"Performance of speech emotion recognition (SER) system mainly depends on whether the extracted features are relevant to emotions conveyed in speech or not. Finding discriminative features for SER is a challenging problem until now. The common and traditional approach for extracting features has been to extract a massive number of features from all frames of utterance. Then applying several statistics for all frames’ features to obtain utterance-level features. However, human emotions have different effects on the properties of each phoneme. Consequently, it has different effect for voiced and unvoiced segments. Therefore, utterance-level features are less effective, due to applying statistics for all frames regardless it is voiced or unvoiced frame. To enrich the discriminative properties of the extracted features, we propose new levels for feature extraction: voiced and unvoiced. The performance using features extracted from the two levels were compared with the utterance-level. For the above three levels; for each frame 13 Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were extracted and then 13 statistics were applied for each level separately. It is found that voiced-level includes many discriminative features furthermore, its performance is close to utterance-level. To improve the traditional SER system, features extracted from both voiced-level and utterance-level were combined. The results of the combined level outperform the traditional one.",Reda Elbarougy,Extracting A Discriminative Acoustic Features from Voiced Segments for Improving Speech Emotion Recognition Accuracy,"Home,Vol 8, No 9 (2019),Elbarougy"
